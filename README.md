# Getting Started

This site contains documentation for Infinity Bot List & its companion API, including documentation about features and tutorials on common use cases.

## Updates

* The site has been updated to our new domain, [https://infinitybotlist.com](https://infinitybotlist.com) Please review all the API docs if they are not working!

## Need Help?

If you need help getting started with our developer API you can always ask the team in our \#development channel in our discord server, in there you can ask questions about our Official Wrapper API's or just our normal ones.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the docs please open a Pull Request on the [Github page](https://github.com/MaximKing1/InfinityBotList-Docs) and in detail explain everything you have added / removed and why.
